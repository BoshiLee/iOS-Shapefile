* iOS-Shapefile is a proof of concept for reading/parsing ESRI shapefiles
	and displaying the resulting shapes in MapKit.
	
* It's built on Pascal Brandt's intial Cocoa work at http://3dgeo.net/CocoaShapefile/CocoaShapefile.htm

* My changes consist of removing dependency on garbage collection, and
	a rudimentary sample app showing district polygons for the Texas Senate.
	
* This proof of concept doesn't take "holes" in polygons into consideration.

* This doesn't cover how to write or edit shapefiles, since I didn't see much utility for that in my iOS projects.

* I've included an iOS targeted PROJ.4 framework.  To be honest, I don't know
	where I initially found it.  However, I'm sure you can find another suitable
	iOS version floating out there somewhere if you need to.  I haven't made 
	any changes to it.
